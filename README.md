# Extract_Target_List
Comparing the list of items in a given file with that in a Master file and finally create a new file with the list of items that were not found in the Master file
This program is meant to help me compare that bird species that have been reported at a particular hotspot by other birders, compare it with my Life list and then create a new file with the set of species that I have not seen before. This will help me make a potential Target Species list
